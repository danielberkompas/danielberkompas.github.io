</blockquote>

<p>Everyone dies, and the world is constantly changing. Therefore, if anything is to be carried on into the future, there must be a <em>succession</em>. Someone new must take up the mission, the art, or the craft, or it will die with the current generation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Programmers should be very familiar with this. How many formerly popular frameworks have been left in the dust? How many popular applications have disappeared? How often have you rewritten old codebases, not necessarily because they were bad, but because they were undocumented and you didn&rsquo;t understand them?</p>

<p>How often has a client come to you, wanting just one feature added to their software, and you ended up telling them the whole thing had to be rewritten? How often have you inherited code from previous developers? How often was that a pleasant experience? How often has a key employee left your company, taking all his knowledge with him, leaving new developers to pick up the pieces? How often has an open source project you rely on been abandoned, forcing you to maintain your own fork?</p>

<p>If your career has been anything like mine, I&rsquo;m guessing that all these things have happened to you, and they weren&rsquo;t fun.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-really-really-bad-at-succession">We are really, really bad at succession</h2>

<p>Most programmers give very little thought to succession. We bang out our code, merrily implementing new features and starting new frameworks, rarely thinking about the long-term implications of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>As a result, our projects don&rsquo;t have READMEs, they have no high-level documentation, no low-level unit documentation, no instructions for new developers, and often few tests. Further, we write them in whatever is new and shiny, rarely thinking about whether the new and shiny will still be shiny as little as six months from now.</p>

<p>If we have any documentation at all, it&rsquo;s usually directed toward our end-users, and talks about how to <em>use</em> the system. The system itself remains an undocumented black box.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p><strong>Code that no one understands is crap.</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t matter what language it is written in, what patterns it uses, or how shiny it was at the time. It&rsquo;s crap. It gets thrown out.</p>

<p><strong>Code that people understand and can extend is good.</strong> Again, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is written in, or whether it has curly braces and semi-colons or not.</p>

<p><strong>Rewrites are wasteful.</strong> Resources that could be used building new functionality are instead being used to reproduce old functionality. It is therefore better to extend than rewrite.</p>

<p><strong>Rewrites produce worse code as often as not.</strong> I know we always feel like we&rsquo;ve made something better when we rewrite it, but this isn&rsquo;t always true. The guy whose code you&rsquo;re rewriting probably thought that he was improving things too.</p>

<p><strong>Businesses can&rsquo;t afford endless rewrites.</strong> Increasingly, programmers with a proven track record of writing maintainable software will get the jobs or the contracts, even if they&rsquo;re not using the new hotness. We get by now due to the fact that programmers are in high demand and people are throwing lots of money at technology to see what will stick. This won&rsquo;t last forever. Eventually, our clientele will become more educated and ask harder questions.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually, you&rsquo;ve got to settle down.</strong> Programmers get old and die like everyone else. Not all of us are going to be able to start our own business or have a comfortable retirement. This means you probably face three options at retirement age:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get into management.</li>
<li>Keep chasing new trends when you&rsquo;re 60. The kids will be better than you at this because they always are.</li>
<li>Make a way for yourself writing maintainable software that stays relevant over the long term. Let the kids play with the new toys.</li>
</ol>

<p>Taking any of these options other than #2 will require planning and preparation, <em>before</em> you hit retirement age.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-can-do-about-it">What you can do about it</h2>

<p>There are some simple disciplines that I think will help keep your code maintainable in the long run.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Think about the next guy who&rsquo;s going to work on your code.</strong> You might not know him. You might not be there for him. So, what does he need to know about your code so that he doesn&rsquo;t just throw it out and waste time rewriting it? Tell him. Make sure he knows how <em>to even get it running.</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t get dazzled so quickly by new technology.</strong> New is not always better. Keep a firm bias toward proven tools and let the new ones mature for a few years. Try not to get locked into a technology that might be discontinued any time soon.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Design your code for extensibility.</strong> Your code will certainly need to change, so try to foresee what types of changes will be required. For example, if it&rsquo;s a reporting app, it&rsquo;s foreseeable that someone will want a new report. Make it easy to add one, and then document how to do it. Isolate the areas of the code that need to change often from the areas that don&rsquo;t.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I admit I haven&rsquo;t always practiced these disciplines, but the older I get, the more value I see in them. They can only make you a better developer, and ensure that those who come after you can succeed. We need a lot more programmers who think about the next guy.</p>

<p>Expect to see more posts on this topic.</p>
