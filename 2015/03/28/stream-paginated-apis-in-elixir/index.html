This past week, as I worked on my new ExTwilio API library for Twilio, I ran into a snag dealing with Twilio&rsquo;s API pagination.

Twilio paginates its &ldquo;list&rdquo; APIs, requiring multiple requests to fetch all of a given resource. However, users of my API library will expect to be able to fetch all of a resource and perform operations on it, like this:

calls = ExTwilio.Call.all
Enum.each calls, fn(call) -&gt;
  # perform some operation
end


Users won&rsquo;t want to mess with the details of pagination. They want to get a collection containing everything and then operate on it.

I find that there are two basic ways to achieve this, a blocking way and a non-blocking way.

<p>This past week, as I worked on my new <a href="https://github.com/danielberkompas/ex_twilio">ExTwilio</a> API library for <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>, I ran into a snag dealing with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/response#response-formats-list">Twilio&rsquo;s API pagination</a>.</p>

<p>Twilio paginates its &ldquo;list&rdquo; APIs, requiring multiple requests to fetch all of a given resource. However, users of my API library will expect to be able to fetch <em>all</em> of a resource and perform operations on it, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">calls = ExTwilio.Call.all
Enum.each calls, fn(call) -&gt;
  # perform some operation
end
</code></pre>

<p>Users won&rsquo;t want to mess with the details of pagination. They want to get a collection containing everything and then operate on it.</p>

<p>I find that there are two basic ways to achieve this, a <em>blocking</em> way and a <em>non-blocking</em> way.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="the-blocking-approach">The Blocking Approach</h2>

<p>In this first approach, we fetch all the pages, merge their results together, and <em>only then</em> return a collection to the caller. The caller is blocked and must wait while this is going on.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t ideal for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will take an unknown amount of time.</li>
<li>Nothing can be done with the data until it has <em>all</em> been loaded.</li>
</ol>

<p>The user probably doesn&rsquo;t want to wait to perform any operations until the entire result set has been fetched.</p>

<h2 id="the-non-blocking-approach">The Non-Blocking Approach</h2>

<p>The second, better approach, is to use Elixir&rsquo;s <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Stream.html">Stream</a> module to create a lazy collection. As we iterate through the collection, the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Stream.html">Stream</a> module will automatically fetch new pages of the API as needed.</p>

<p>You can think of the Stream here like a bucket used to fetch water from a well. The well is the API, and the bucket can hold one page of results at a time. The Stream returns items from the bucket, one at a time.</p>

<p>The logic to follow looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, we fill the bucket with the first page of results from the well.</li>
<li>We then pour out the bucket, one result at a time.</li>
<li>If the bucket is empty and the well is also empty, stop.</li>
<li>If the bucket is empty and the well still has water, fill the bucket again and resume pouring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Results from the well can be processed as each &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; arrives, and the bucket will be refilled as long as there are still results left.</p>

<p>How do we implement this in Elixir? We start by defining a <code>stream</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">def stream
  start = fn -&gt; end
  next_item = fn -&gt; end
  stop = fn -&gt; end

  Stream.resource(start, next_item, stop)
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Stream.html#resource/3">Stream.resource/3</a> method takes three funs.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>start</code> is used to initialize the Stream, and set its initial state.</li>
<li><code>next_item</code> takes the Stream&rsquo;s previous state and returns a tuple, like so: {[next item for collection], new_state}</li>
<li><code>stop</code> is a handy hook to clean up once the Stream is finished.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at each of these in order.</p>

<h2 id="start">start</h2>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">start = fn -&gt;
  # Assumes there is a list/0 method that will fetch the first page
  # of the API, in the format {status, items, paging_metadata}
  case list do
    {:ok, items, meta} -&gt; {items, meta[&quot;next_page_uri&quot;]}
    _error             -&gt; {[], nil}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We will store our state for the Stream in a two-element tuple, in this format: <code>{items, next_page_url}</code>. If our <code>list/0</code> method returns the first page successfully, we&rsquo;ll fill the state with that first page of items.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the first page doesn&rsquo;t load, we&rsquo;ll start with an empty state which we&rsquo;ll make cause the Stream to finish instantly.</p>

<h2 id="next-item">next_item</h2>

<p>This is where things get interesting.</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">next_item = fn state = {[], nil}  -&gt; {:halt, state}
               state = {[], next} -&gt; fetch_next_page.(state)
               state              -&gt; pop_item.(state)
end
</code></pre>

<p>The logic is pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there are no items left in the current page, and there is no next page, then stop.</li>
<li>If there are no items left in the current page, but there is a next page, then go get that page.</li>
<li>If neither of the above are true, pop an item off the state and return it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there are two new funs here, <code>fetch_next_page</code> and <code>pop_item</code>. They look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir"># Use pattern matching to pop the top item off the list of items, passing the
# tail as the new state.
pop_item = fn {[head|tail], next} -&gt;
  new_state = {tail, next}
  {[head], new_state}
end

# Get the next page, and use pop_item to both set the new state and return the
# first item of the new page.
fetch_next_page = fn state = {[], next_page} -&gt;
  # Assumes you have a method called `fetch_page` which will take a page URL and
  # get that page of results.
  case fetch_page(next_page) do
    {:ok, items, meta} -&gt; pop_item.({items, meta[&quot;next_page_uri&quot;]})
    {:error, _msg}     -&gt; {:halt, state}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="stop">stop</h2>

<p>The simplest function of all! We don&rsquo;t really have anything to clean up.</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">stop = fn(_state) -&gt; end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>Our complete <code>stream/0</code> method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">def stream
  start = fn -&gt;
    # Assumes there is a list/0 method that will fetch the first page
    # of the API, in the format {status, items, paging_metadata}
    case list do
      {:ok, items, meta} -&gt; {items, meta[&quot;next_page_uri&quot;]}
      _error             -&gt; {[], nil}
    end
  end

  # Use pattern matching to pop the top item off the list of items, passing the
  # tail as the new state.
  pop_item = fn {[head|tail], next} -&gt;
    new_state = {tail, next}
    {[head], new_state}
  end

  # Get the next page, and use pop_item to both set the new state and return the
  # first item of the new page.
  fetch_next_page = fn state = {[], next_page} -&gt;
    # Assumes you have a method called `fetch_page` which will take a page URL and
    # get that page of results.
    case fetch_page(next_page) do
      {:ok, items, meta} -&gt; pop_item.({items, meta[&quot;next_page_uri&quot;]})
      {:error, _msg}     -&gt; {:halt, state}
    end
  end

  next_item = fn state = {[], nil}  -&gt; {:halt, state}
                 state = {[], next} -&gt; fetch_next_page.(state)
                 state              -&gt; pop_item.(state)
  end

  stop = fn(_state) -&gt; end

  Stream.resource(start, next_item, stop)
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can now stream through resources to your heart&rsquo;s content! For example, you can process all of your Twilio Calls like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">Enum.each ExTwilio.Call.stream, fn(call) -&gt;
  IO.puts call.sid
end
</code></pre>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s just a Stream, you can also <em>stack operations</em> on the stream which will be lazily executed whenever you want!</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir"># Find calls that were longer than 2 minutes (160 seconds)
# &quot;stream&quot; is returned instantly
stream = Stream.filter ExTwilio.Call.stream, fn(call) -&gt;
  call.duration &gt; 120
end

# Append another operation to get just the call SIDs. Only calls that got
# through the filter above will be mapped.
stream = Stream.map stream, fn(call) -&gt; call.sid end

# Execute all the operations and return a collection:
Enum.into stream, [] # =&gt; [&quot;CN234098123....&quot;, &quot;CN123098123...&quot;]

# Or, just put out all the sids
Enum.each stream, fn(sid) -&gt;
  IO.puts sid
end
</code></pre>

<p>Using this technique, you can programmatically build up filters on your remote paged resources, knowing that all those filters will only be executed when you need the final data. (Aside: this is very similar to ActiveRecord::Relation)</p>

<p>In short, this is very cool. But you knew that.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/danielberkompas/ex_twilio">ExTwilio</a> supports streaming for all Twilio endpoints that have a paged API. For those masochistic users who still want a blocking method, I&rsquo;ve given them an <code>all</code> method as well. Internally, it just delegates to <code>stream</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-elixir">def all do
  Enum.into stream, []
end
</code></pre>
