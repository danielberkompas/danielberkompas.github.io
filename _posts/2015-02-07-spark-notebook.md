My wife recently backed the [Spark Notebook Kickstarter][spark-notebook-kickstarter].
and she kindly ordered me two of them as a late Christmas present.

So far, _I love it_. You know how we all make New Year's Resolutions and then
break them? Thanks to this notebook, this is the first year I feel like I have a
fighting chance of actually accomplishing my goals.

The notebook is set up to encourage you to telescope in on your goals, starting
from a high level, all the way down to your day-to-day routine. It's structured
like this:

1. A theme for the year, with supporting goals.
2. Monthly goals, complete with a calendar.
3. Weekly goals, with a week planner.

It also comes with project planners and ordinary note-taking pages.

By constantly encouraging to review your high-level goals, the notebook helps
you stay on track with your daily goals, making sure that everything is in sync.
Your big goals get broken up into smaller, achievable goals, and you can see how
it all adds up to the big picture.

So, even if you're a developer (like me), or usually use computers to solve
these kinds of problems (like me), I **strongly** encourage you to get a Spark
Notebook.

There might be [some left][spark-notebook].
