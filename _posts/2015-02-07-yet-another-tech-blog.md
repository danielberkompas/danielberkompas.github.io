title: Yet Another Tech Blog

After a long series of attempts to get my blog up and running, I've finally settled on a stack I can be happy with for now: [Jekyll][jekyll] on [Github pages][github-pages].  It's secure, doesn't require me to mess with hosting, and lets me write, which is after all what a blog is all about.

I plan to write about my day-to-day experiences with technology, particularly the tech that I'm using or learning. No promises that I'll restrict myself to that, but we'll see what the future holds.
