title: Yet Another Tech Blog
---

After a long series of attempts to get my blog up and running, I've finally
settled on a stack I can be happy with for now: [Jekyll][jekyll] on 
[Github pages][github-pages].  It's secure, doesn't require me to mess with 
hosting, and lets me write, which is after all what a blog is all about.

I plan to write about my day-to-day experiences with technology, particularly
the tech that I'm using or learning. No promises that I'll restrict myself to
that, but we'll see what the future holds.
