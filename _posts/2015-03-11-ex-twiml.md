At [LeadSimple](http://leadsimple.com), we use [Twilio](http://twilio.com) to
handle phone call routing. Twilio interacts with regular HTTP endpoints on your
server to control calls and SMS messages, through a form of XML they call `TwiML`.

I've been toying recently ideas on how to bring next-generation Erlang (Elixir) 
and next-generation telephony (Twilio) together. Toward that end, I made a
little library this week to make generating TwiML from Elixir easy.

<!-- more -->

It looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule YourModule do
  import ExTwiml

  def render do
    twiml do
      play "/assets/welcome.mp3"
      gather digits: 4, finish_on_key: "#" do
        say """
        Please enter the last four digits of your credit card number, followed 
        by the pound sign.
        """, voice: "woman"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Calling `YourModule.render` will return the following XML as a string:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Play>/assets/welcome.mp3</Play>
  <Gather digits="4" finishOnKey="#">
    <Say voice="woman">
      Please enter the last four digits of your credit card number, followed by
      the pound sign.
    </Say>
  </Gather>
</Response>
```

The library is called [ExTwiml](https://github.com/danielberkompas/ex_twiml).
It's available from Github or [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_twiml).
