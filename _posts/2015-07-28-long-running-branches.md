Today, I intend to rail against the evils of long-lived feature branches. Having
collaborated on a number of projects where they happened, I'm now convinced that
they are almost always the wrong way to go.

## Why We Do Long-Lived Branches

The reasoning behind these branches is simple. Your boss wants the program to 
keep running like it is, but he wants a large, complex feature to be implemented
that will touch a lot of the codebase.

Many teams respond to this by creating a feature branch in source control, in
which the feature will be developed until such a time that it is "ready". Normal
development continues in the main branches while the feature is being developed.

## What's Wrong With Them

There are many problems with this approach, but I think they can be summarized
as two large problems.

First, **code review becomes messy and ineffective.** When the feature branch is finally
merged into the `master` branch, the diff is too large to review effectively.
I've been handed diffs like this to review before, and my eyes glaze over after
about 300 lines of code. The sheer volume of code to review reduces the quality
of my review, because I don't want to sit and review code all day, so I rush
through it. Rushed code reviews are worse than no code review at all, because
they give the illusion that code has been reviewed when in fact it has not. 

Second, **merging becomes hard.** The longer a branch lives, the more different
the main branch becomes, and the more difficult it can be to keep the two in
sync. You can mitigate this by doing frequent merges and rebases in from
`master`, but many developers neglect this.

In the end, you have a giant blob of code that isn't very well tested or
reviewed, and which probably conflicts with your `master` branch in a number of
significant ways. In the projects I worked on, this either resulted in serious
bugs or significant delays getting the feature done.

## A Better Way

Like many others have written, I recommend that you develop each feature as
incrementally as possible, merging as often as possible into your `master`
branch. Ensure the tests are all passing after each incremental change. Put the
feature behind a feature flipper if possible, or, if the feature changes too
many things, start a new "main" branch where all development will occur and use
`master` only for hotfixes until the feature is done.

This approach ensures that pull requests are small, and therefore makes code
review a meaningful process. Also, there's no fear that `master` will get very far
ahead in the two or three hours that each little feature branch lives.

So, please, no more massive pull requests! Keep your branches small, your
commits focused, and merge often.
