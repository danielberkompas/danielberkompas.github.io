Over the past year and a half or so, I have been teaching a programming class.
We started out learning the command line and Git, and then moved on to Ruby.
In the process, I quickly found out that Ruby isn't quite as easy to understand
as I thought it was.

This year, I pressed the reset button, and am teaching the class Elixir instead
of Ruby, in the hope that functional programming will make more sense to
beginners than object-oriented programming does.

Toward that end, I started working on a screencast which I'm now happy to
announce to the public: [LearnElixir.tv][learn_elixir]. Please check it out!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from [ElixirSips][elixirsips]?

I'm a happy subscriber to Josh Adam's [ElixirSips][elixirsips] screencast. If 
you're not already a subscriber, go sign up for it now! It's great.

However, I felt like there was room for a screencast oriented more toward 
complete beginners who want to learn Elixir's features from start to finish, 
like they would read a book. That's the need [LearnElixir.tv][learn_elixir] 
tries to fill.

### What topics does [LearnElixir.tv][learn_elixir] cover?

It is still a work in progress, but it will eventually cover Elixir's main
features and the most important parts of its standard library. When it is
finished, a beginner should be able to get up and running from the screencast 
alone.

### How many episodes will there be?

At least 20, but beyond that, as many as it takes to cover the subject matter 
to my satisfaction.

### What does it cost?

Right now, **$9.** One time. It's a steal. This price covers the episodes on
Elixir's built-in features and standard library. I'll raise it soon, so get it 
while it's this cheap!

Future episodes on special topics, like Phoenix or Ecto, may require payment per
episode or require a subscription.

### How to submit suggestions/corrections
