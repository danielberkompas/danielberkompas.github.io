      <description>I was born in 1991 in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, which is also where I currently live. I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian, married to a wonderful woman, and have 3 crazy little kids.
Occupation I create software for a living, with a focus on backend servers. About 4 years ago, I discovered Elixir and mainly write in and about that, though I do have experience with Ruby on Rails and modern Javascript.</description>
